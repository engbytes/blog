Recently i have set-up this blog using Hugo. I was able to do it over
a weekend. It was a fun & rewarding experience. If you are interested in setting
up a static blog/website all you have to do is follow these 6 simple steps

__1) Select your theme__

> Hugo has a wide variety of themes to select from. Pick your favorite [here] (https://themes.gohugo.io)

__2) Setting it up locally__

>Follow the quick start guide [here] (https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

__3) Customise your theme__

> * Go to your theme page [https://themes.gohugo.io/YOUR_THEME_NAME/]
> * Click on Homepage button, that will take you to github page of the link
> * Github repo should have all the necessary documentation for enabling/disabling
various options and customizing the theme according to your need.


__4) Hosting and deployment__

> * Once everything is working locally, its time to deploy.
> * There are various options for [deploying your website] (https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/), I choose to do so via github using github user pages
> * Github allows free hosting of static pages and provides custom domain for the same (username.github.io)
> * Follow this link for details of set-up with [github user pages] (https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
> * Congrats!, you now have your website up and running at (username.github.io)



__5) Using a personal domain__

> * If you want to use a personal domain for e.g (myname.com), instead of (username.github.io).

> * Then you have to buy a custom domain name via any domain name provider like
[godaddy](https://godaddy.com) or [namecheap](https://namecheap.com) 
> * I ended up buying mine via godaddy


__6) Setting up personal domain with github pages__

> * This could have been tricky and little time consuming but then i stumbled upon a great post
written by [Kirsten Swanson] (https://hackernoon.com/@kswanie21)
> * Here is the [post] (https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b) to set-up GoDaddy domain with GitHub pages
> * Incase, you have bought your domain via other provider, you can easily find similar post to configure github pages.



```Well that's it. You now have your personal blog/website up and running with the domain name of your choice.
